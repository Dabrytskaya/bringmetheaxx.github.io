# bringmetheaxx: neon lights 1985
### the concept

this homepage had 4 concepts in 3 days so yeah,<br>
my mind is a mess.<br>
the first concept was 80's color-blocking and<br>
I didn't liked it.<br>
then I changed the concept to disco and again<br>
I didn't like it.<br>
the third one was neon pastel and it was beautiful,<br>
so beautiful that I decided to use it for another<br>
project.<br>
I didn't want to build 2 websites with the same concept<br>
and color palette so here we go searching for a new concept.<br>
the neon lights campy trashy concept somehow has all the concepts<br>
I tried before, a little bit of color-blocking,<br>
a little bit of disco and a lot of neon, not pastel,<br>
yet a good option and I like the result until now.<br>
of course it will last a couple of days or hours<br>
because this is who I am.

### the homepage

this is my personal homepage so I want to put a little<br>
bit of everything I am. the question is: what I am?<br>
and that's why this is everything<br>
going to everywhere. the idea is to present<br>
myself and to play with coding,<br>
try new things, explore, be campy.<br>  

there is still a lot to be done and I will be updating<br>
and making it better with the time and the knowledge<br> I
hope I will get.<br>

### projects

this is supposed to be the professional part of the<br>
website and of course it is the part that doesn't<br>
have anything. first because I am learning and<br>
second because I don't have a job, so please can you<br>
hire me? pleaseeeee.....

### playlists

for this project I decided to create a special playlist<br>
with my favorite songs of the week and update it every<br>
sunday. who cares about that? no one and I know, but<br> I
want to do and I will do.<br>
So keep tuned (I know you won't) to see which great song<br>
will appear in my playlist on the next sunday.<br>
I am also creating some playlists just because I can so<br>
my homepage will have a special session for random<br>
playlists that nobody will listen and yet I will share.<br>
### philosophy

this is my homepage so I can do whenever I want,<br>
at least it what I think so deal with it.<br>
some of the great philosophers of out time<br>
didn't get the recognition they deserve so<br>
I will do this service to bring some<br>
modern philosophy to the world every week.<br>
you can suggest your favorites philosophers<br>
too at my mailbox. <br>
if you still reading, I want to thank you for your kindness.
